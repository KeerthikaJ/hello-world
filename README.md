Hi everyone,

I am Keerthika, a big dreamer. Brought up from a happy middle class famiy from Tamilnadu, India. 
I like to deal with problems and solving them.. So I chose programming which helps me in solving the most difficult programs in a creative way. The code of lines makes me excited and I am a big Java lover. I want to learn more technologies for which this github account would help me. Hoping for best!!
